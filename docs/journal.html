                        <p class="content">trying out the journal feature ...the thought here is that i can supplant tweeting witn tbis, not just to
use twitter less but also because my tweets r generally more introspective or meditative , which is
not a bad thing its just not really suited for the platform, i dont need everyone to see it i just need
to get it out there. this is supported by the fact of me struggling to engage in a conversation
resulting from any one of these tweets , usually i find it gard tk come up witb a good response. this
carries over to in person intellectual dialogue too , i just speak to speak and get stuff off my mind
that im thinking of.
why not notes?
to multipurpose. journal means journal
why not by hand like i used to?
im a faster mobile typist than i am handwriter. also bluetooth allows me to connect my keyboard if
im in a verbose mood. cant do thay with a notebook
hoping this is fruitful</p>
